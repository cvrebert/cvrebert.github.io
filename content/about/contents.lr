Hi, I'm Chris Rebert. I'm a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area, the same place I grew up. I am fascinated by [programming language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory) and have a B.S. in Computer Science from [UCSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego). For a while, I was an active member of the [Bootstrap project's](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) [Core Team](http://getbootstrap.com/about/#team) of maintainers.

### Pronunciation
My last name can be correctly pronounced either as "reh-burt" (first syllable rhymes with "meh") or "ray-bear", depending on how you feel about the French language.
